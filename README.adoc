Deployment note:

The response body generated by the LambdaServer is always base64 encoded. You have to configure your
API gateway to decode the response from the LambdaServer before forwarding it back to the client.
In your API gateway configuration, go to Binary Support and add a binary media type: */*.

Regarding vertx wrapper, I copied the code from :https://github.com/noseka1/vertx-aws-lambda

== Development note:

This is a aws lambda of java vertx sample code, which includes several other vertx sample code as well.

aws handler class: com.charter.metadata.vertx.test.VertxHandler
